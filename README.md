Abstract:
This guide presents CRQAI-50 (Comprehensive Research Quality Assessment Instrument), a structured framework designed to facilitate systematic, transparent, and consistent evaluation of academic manuscripts. The instrument breaks down research quality into ten measurable criteria encompassing originality, methodological rigor, analytical soundness, ethical integrity, and overall scholarly contribution.
Developed with particular attention to the humanities and social sciences, CRQAI-50 provides a balanced quantitative-qualitative approach, awarding a maximum of 50 points across 30 specific sub-indicators. Each criterion includes clear scoring guidelines (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 points) to minimize reviewer subjectivity and enhance assessment reliability.
The framework serves multiple stakeholders: researchers can conduct rigorous self-assessments prior to submission; peer reviewers and editorial boards can standardize evaluation processes; and academic institutions can implement it for internal review or training purposes. The included ready-to-use evaluation form facilitates immediate practical application.
This release represents the quick-reference version of CRQAI-50. A comprehensive manual with extended case studies and discipline-specific adaptations is forthcoming from the same author.
